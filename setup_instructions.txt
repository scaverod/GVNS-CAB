✓ Shows professional software development practices

🔧 HOW TO CREATE A RELEASE:

1. Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed to main:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for v1.0.0 release"
   git push origin main

2. Go to your repository on GitHub

3. Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar (or go to /releases)

4. Click "Create a new release" or "Draft a new release"

5. Fill in the release information:

   📌 Choose a tag:
   - Click "Choose a tag"
   - Type: v1.0.0 (for your first release)
   - Click "Create new tag: v1.0.0 on publish"
   
   Versioning scheme (Semantic Versioning):
   - v1.0.0 = Initial release with paper publication
   - v1.0.1 = Bug fixes, no new features
   - v1.1.0 = Minor improvements or new features
   - v2.0.0 = Major changes or breaking changes

   📝 Release title:
   Example: "v1.0.0 - Initial Publication Release"
   Or: "v1.0.0 - [Paper Title] Implementation"

   📄 Description (use this template):
   ```

8. Click "Publish release"

📦 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER PUBLISHING:

- GitHub creates a permanent snapshot (zip and tar.gz archives)
- Users can download source code for this specific version
- If connected to Zenodo, a DOI is automatically generated
- The release appears in your repository's sidebar
- You can reference this specific version in your paper

🔄 CREATING SUBSEQUENT RELEASES:

When you fix bugs or add features after publication:

1. Make your changes and commit them
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with what changed
3. Create a new release with a new version number:
   - v1.0.1 for bug fixes
   - v1.1.0 for new features
   - v2.0.0 for major changes

4. In the release description, mention:
   ```
   ## What's Changed
   - Fixed bug in algorithm X (#issue_number)
   - Improved performance of function Y
   - Updated documentation
   
   ## Full Changelog
   See CHANGELOG.md for complete details
   ```

💡 BEST PRACTICES:

- Create a release when your paper is accepted/published
- Create new releases for significant bug fixes
- Always include the compiled .jar in release assets
- Update the README badge to show latest release:
  ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/username/repository)
- Tag releases with version numbers that match your citations
- Keep release descriptions clear and informative

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Releases are permanent and cannot be deleted (only hidden)
- Source code snapshots are automatically created by GitHub
- Once a release is published, the tag cannot be changed
- Plan your version number carefully before publishing
- Consider creating a pre-release (v1.0.0-rc1) before the final version
